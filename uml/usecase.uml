== Traffic Control Functionality ==
CAM --> JC : IP address, Demand ID
CAM <-- JC : Demand
note left of CAM
    - Communicates with cameras using LvRestful
    - Parses JSON data with LvJSON
end note
CAM --> CM : Demand data 
CM --> TC : GPIO signals (via optocoupler)
note right of TC
    - Receives GPIO signals (virtual loop demand)
end note

== DC Input Functionality ==
DC --> DCM : Pedestrian button/Door sensor status
DCM --> COM : Pedestrian button/Door sensor status
COM --> SW : MQTT payload pedestrian button/door sensor status
note left of COM
    - example dcinput/pedestrian and dcinput/door as topic
end note

== AC Monitoring Functionality ==
TL --> AM : AC input from traffic light
note right of TL
    - Monitors AC signal powering traffic lights after optocoupler.
end note
AM --> COM : Traffic light status
COM --> SW : MQTT payload traffic light status
note left of COM
    - example trafficlight/status as topic
end note

== Power Management Functionality ==
UPS --> UM : Power status (through RS485)
UM --> COM : Power source change
COM --> SW : MQTT payload notify outage
note left of COM
    - example ups/power as topic
end note
